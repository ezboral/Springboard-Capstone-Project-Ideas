# Springboard Capstone Project 


## Problem - Predicting the Accuracy of Credit Card Default
At the end of March 2016 outstanding credit card debt totaled just over \$750 billion in the US alone. For households that carry an unpaid balance each month, the average debt was just over \$16,000 at the end of the same period. [Credit Card Data](https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-credit-card-debt) 

While outstanding credit card debt presents a risk to the consumer in the form of higher interest payments, it also presents a risk to the lender in the form of a potential default. Is it possible to identify characteristics of borrowers who are either more or less likely to default on their credit card debt? 

  
## Client


Credit cards are usually issued by a bank or credit card company.  When the issuer is unlikely to collect credit card debt, they will write it off as a loss or charge-off.  At the end of 2016, credit card charge-offs were 3.37% for the top 100 US banks ranked by assets. [Write off Data](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/CORCCT100S) 

Assessing who is more likely to repay is at the heart of the lending industry. A predictive model that can more accurately profile of a reliable borrower is very valuable information to financial institutions and can ultimatley help them reduce their write-off rates. 


## Data


While not focused on the US market, the data set for this project looked at one response variable (default or payment of credit card debt in October 2005). 

Y: Client action; 0 = no default; 1 = default

The following 23 independent variables were also included.

X1: Dollar amount of loan<br/>
X2: Gender of borrower (1 = male; 2 = female)<br/>
X3: Level of education (1 = graduate school; 2 = university; 3 = high school; 0, 4, 5, 6 = others)<br/>
X4: Marital status (1 = married; 2 = single; 3 = divorce; 0 = others)<br/>
X5: Age in years<br/>
X6-X11: Past monthly payments, X6 = repayment status in September of 2005;...; X11 = repayment status in April of 2005<br/>
The payment scale: -2 = No consumption; -1 = Paid in full; 0: The use of revolving credit; 1 = payment delay for 1 month; 
2 = payment delay for 2 months;...; 8 = payment delay for 8 months; 9 = payment delay for 9 months and above<br/>
X12-X17: Past monthly balances, X12 = balance in September of 2005;...; X17 = balance in April of 2005<br/>
X18-X23: Amount of previous payments, X18 = amount paid in September of 2005;...; X23 = amount paid in April of 2005<br/>

Data is available at the following link: [Data set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients)

The data are provided in a CSV file.  The data will require very little manipulation as every categorical field has a binary value (0, 1, etc). Some column names may need to be changed (for example BILL_AMT6 to BILL_April).


## Approach


Let's discuss on our call.  Some ideas I had include:<br/>
* First looking at relationahips between 1 independent variable and default (for example, education level and default, or marital status and default etc.)<br/>
* Then maybe combining some variables.  For example, if we look at education level and loans above a certain amount.<br/> 
* Try to draw some conclusions about the rate of payment for past monthly balances and payment schedule.<br/>
* Problems might be the large number of independent variables.  How do we isolate and analyse what's important?


## Deliverables


The deliverables for this project will all be loaded onto github. These will include the code used to manipulate and analyse data.  In addition, there will be a report including key findings, graphs, and final conclusions.
